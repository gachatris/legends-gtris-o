 - This feature includes Keybinding menus.
 - In every new version update appears the changelog/patch notes window. You will see how many changes have been done for a new version. You can go to the changelog window by searching for "Changelogs (Patch Notes)" selection in the Main Menu screen of the game.

## RPG Mode (Alpha):
 - This mode is in Alpha stage, meaning that there are bugs present in the mode. If you discover bugs in this mode, report them to the developer.
 - A player can only pick 3 UNIQUE characters as cards in their deck; they can use the same character as their opponent. All 3 characters in their deck add up HP and Mana depending on the attributes of each of them.
 - Each character has a unique skill or so, with some remarkable features, buffs, and debuffs contained; enough mana will be used for every skill use. Mana costs vary on a card.
 - The goal of a player is to force their opponent's HP down to 0. Every top-out or pile-out costs them a fraction of their HP.
